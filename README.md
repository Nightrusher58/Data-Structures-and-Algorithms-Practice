Overview
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Practice repository! This repository is designed to help students practice various data structures and algorithms through a collection of questions and solutions. Whether you are preparing for technical interviews or looking to deepen your understanding of these fundamental concepts, this resource is here to assist you.

Contents
The repository is organized into the following sections:

Arrays and Strings

Common array and string manipulation problems.
Linked Lists

Problems related to singly and doubly linked lists.
Stacks and Queues

Implementations and problems related to stacks and queues.
Trees and Graphs

Problems involving binary trees, binary search trees, and graphs.
Sorting and Searching

Algorithms for sorting and searching in arrays.
Dynamic Programming

Problems requiring dynamic programming techniques.
Recursion and Backtracking

Problems solved using recursion and backtracking strategies.
Hashing and Maps

Problems that involve hash tables and maps.
Greedy Algorithms

How to Use
Each file contains a set of questions along with their corresponding solutions. To get the most out of this repository, follow these steps:

Choose a Topic: Select a topic you want to practice. For example, if you want to work on Linked List algorithms, navigate to the "Linked List" section.

Select a Question: Browse through the list of questions in that section and choose one that interests you.

Attempt the Problem: Try to solve the problem on your own. Take notes, sketch diagrams, and think through your approach.

Check the Solution: Once you've given it your best shot, look at the provided solution. Compare it with your own and understand the logic behind it.

Optimize Your Solution: If you were successful, try to optimize your solution. If not, understand the provided solution thoroughly and attempt the problem again later.
